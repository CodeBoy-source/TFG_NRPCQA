abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.}

abstract = {Several contemporaneous image processing and computer vision systems rely upon the full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) measures. The single-scale structural similarity index (SS-SSIM) is one of the most popular measures, and it owes its success to the mathematical simplicity, low computational complexity, and implicit incorporation of Human Visual System’s (HVS) characteristics. In this paper, we revise the original parameters of SSIM and its multi-scale counterpart (MS-SSIM) to increase their correlation with subjective evaluation. More specifically, we exploit the evolutionary computation and the swarm intelligence methods on five popular IQA databases, two of which are dedicated distance-changed databases, to determine the best combination of parameters efficiently. Simultaneously, we explore the effect of different scale selection approaches in the context of SS-SSIM. The experimental results show that with a proper fine-tuning (1) the performance of SS-SSIM and MS-SSIM can be improved, in average terms, by 8% and by 3%, respectively, (2) the SS-SSIM after the so-called standard scale selection achieves similar performance as if applying computationally more expensive state-of-the-art scale selection methods or MS-SSIM; moreover, (3) there is evidence that the parameters learned on a given database can be successfully transferred to other (previously unseen) databases; finally, (4) we propose a new set of reference parameters for SSIM’s variants and provide their interpretation.}

    abstract = "{Various methods and post-processing software packages have been developed to quantify left atrial (LA) fibrosis using 3D late gadolinium-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) images. Currently, it remains unclear how the results of these methods and software packages interrelate.Forty-seven atrial fibrillation (AF) patients underwent 3D-LGE-CMR imaging prior to their AF ablation. LA fibrotic burden was derived from the images using open-source CEMRG software and commercially available ADAS 3D-LA software. Both packages were used to calculate fibrosis based on the image intensity ratio (IIR)-method. Additionally, CEMRG was used to quantify LA fibrosis using three standard deviations (3SD) above the mean blood pool signal intensity. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to compare LA fibrosis quantification methods and different post-processing software outputs. The percentage of LA fibrosis assessed using IIR threshold 1.2 was significantly different from the 3SD-method (29.80 ± 14.15\\% vs. 8.43 ± 5.42\\%; P \\&lt; 0.001). Correlation between the IIR-and SD-method was good (r = 0.85, P \\&lt; 0.001) although agreement was poor [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.19; P \\&lt; 0.001]. One-third of the patients were allocated to a different fibrosis category dependent on the used quantification method. Fibrosis assessment using CEMRG and ADAS 3D-LA showed good agreement for the IIR-method (ICC = 0.93; P \\&lt; 0.001).Both, the IIR1.2 and 3SD-method quantify atrial fibrotic burden based on atrial wall signal intensity differences. The discrepancy in the amount of LA fibrosis between these methods may have clinical implications when patients are classified according to their fibrotic burden. There was no difference in results between post-processing software packages to quantify LA fibrosis if an identical quantification method including the threshold was used.}",
